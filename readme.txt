== Frequently Asked Questions ==

FAQs are maintained on the [wp-Typography website](https://code.mundschenk.at/wp-typography/frequently-asked-questions/).

Two questions come up so frequently, we will republish their answers here:

= Will this plu­gin slow my page load­ing times? =

Yes. Use [WP Super Cache](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/).

= This plugin breaks post title links. What gives? =

More likely than not, your WordPress theme is using an improper function to set the title attribute of your heading's link.  It is probably using the `the_title()` function, which delivers the post title *after* filtering.  It should be using `the_title_attribute()` which delivers the post title *before* filtering.  Change out this function throughout your theme when it is used inside of an HTML tag, and the problem should go away.

If you are uncomfortable editing your theme's code, you may alternatively go to the wp-Typography settings page in your admin panel and add `h1` and `h2` to the "Do not process the content of these HTML elements:" field.  This will disable typographic processing within improperly designed page title links <em>and</em> page titles.

Remember, many more FAQs are are addressed the [wp-Typography website](https://code.mundschenk.at/wp-typography/frequently-asked-questions/).

= I'm using Advanced Custom Fields and don't want my custom fields to be hyphenated! How can I disable that behavior? =

Please install the [wp-Typography Disable ACF Integration plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-typography-disable-acf-integration/) by @sarukku.
